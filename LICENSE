Preamble

The Lattice engine is a proprietary learning system developed solo by Jeremiah Saunders for the benefit of Lock In. Our mission is to empower students through high-integrity, focused learning environments. To preserve the unique integrity and methodology of the Lattice ecosystem, this license restricts institutional and commercial use. It is designed to allow individual hackers and students to explore the source code privately while ensuring that any organized educational or commercial deployment is managed exclusively by or through Lock In.
